## To edit
### Editing CSS:
When linking css to an html file, use style.css as the only stylesheet. If you make another stylesheet, import it into style.css.
### Live editing:
Use ```npm start``` to open the application (make sure you've installed all dependencies using ```npm install``` at least once). Once you make any changes, hit ```ctrl+r``` in the app to refresh the page. To restart the app, enter ```rs``` in the terminal. Opening the html file in a browser directly will prevent the JS from loading.
